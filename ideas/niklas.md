Into: You are tired in a shopping mall and lie down in a bed. Some person appears "You can't just lie down in a bed in a shop... To teach you a lesson you are stuck in a body of a llama now. And to always give you the first reactions of people to llamas, you are stuck in a time loop from this moment on". To prove the point the person could just kill the player here.


You need a knife for something => some npc you can be mean to threatens you "I know where the kitchen knife is, don't you mock me!". After the player knows he needs a knife, he can further mock the npc to watch him get the knife and kill the player.
