# A shitty day | Game for Mini Jam 72

*Limitation: Death must be a core mechanic*

The idea of "A shitty day" is that the player keeps dying and respawning at the same place and situation. By trying all kinds of different interactions with other entities in the game the player needs to escape this cycle.
